By utilizing Garner I have started to recreate Bob_Bot, however this version only works with Discord. I will continue to update this as I am running it on a remote server.

Bob_Bot will be a public bot in the future, however since it is still under heavy development I'm not willing to give it to a potentially volitile situation yet.

If you would like to help develop the bot or run it on your own server go ahead.

Create a new file named "login.json", in it:
{
	"guildInfo": {"username": "", "password": ""},
	"commands": {"username": "", "password": ""},
	"clientId": ""
}
