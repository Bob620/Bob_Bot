I'm going to be updating these files more often(Hopefully). It will contain my new recreation of Bob_Bot to be used for both Toka.io and Twitch chats. If you want help making your own chat bot through Python, feel free to contact me any time.

Mind you at this point on development it will be large changes going into this that may change fundamental parts of the code. Also most of the code is missing, both base code and extra code.

I'll be making the bot on only one document, however may have other resource files that it would read/write to to show the structure of them aswell.
