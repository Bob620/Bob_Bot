# Discord Server for Requesting and Updates

[Waifu Discord Group](https://discord.gg/Tj4wmer)

Bob_Bot will be a public bot in the future, however since it is still under heavy development I'm not willing to give it to a potentially volatile situation yet.

If you would like to help develop the bot or run it on your own server go ahead.

# Connecting to services

### Discord and Chata
Create a new file named "login.json", in it:
``` json
{
  "discordToken": "DiscordToken",
  "chataToken": "ChataToken"
}

```

### AWS
It runs off the normal AWS modules, and thus you need to create the files properly

###### Currently it's required to have AWS access
